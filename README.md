# covid19_trend_analysis_italy
This repository provides a simple analysis of 
- the COVID-19 infections trend for Italy, its regions and its provinces;
- the use of vaccines for Italy.

To do this, data from the following open-source Github repository, added as submodules, are used:
- https://github.com/pcm-dpc/COVID-19.git
- https://github.com/italia/covid19-opendata-vaccini.git

The analysis is done in Python by using the "Bokeh" interactive visualization library.
Before run the cells of the Jupyter lab notebook, you need to:

- install Python language;
- install the requirements with the command "pip install -r requirements.txt".
